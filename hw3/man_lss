NAME

	lss - list directory contents in long listing format, sorted by size in descending order


SYNOPSIS

	lss [OPTIONS]... [FILE]...


DESCRIPTION

	List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
	Allows most of ls(1)'s options except for:
		-g, -G, -i, -s.

	-g - makes it so that owner is not listed, which is an unnecessary feature for lss.
	-G (or --no-group) - makes it so that group is not listed, which is an unncessary
						feature for lss.
	-i (or --inode) - prints out the inode numebr for each file, messing up the sorting
						in lss, so it was ommited.
	-s (or --size) - prints out the allocated size of each file, messing up the sorting
						in lss, so it was ommited.

	Exit Status:
		0	if OK,
		1	if minor problems (e.g., used an invalid option or ls(1) returned exit status of 1),
		2	if ls(1) returned exit status of 2.
