SRM(1)									USER COMMANDS									SRM(1)

NAME

	srm - 'safe remove' files or directories


SYNOPSIS

	srm [FILE]...


DESCRIPTION

	srm 'safe removes' files or directories. Unlike rm(1), it does 'safe remove'
	directories; it returns an exit status of 1 if given no arguments.

	srm moves the specified files and directories to a global trashbin directory
	in the user's home directory, created upon command call if it does not
	exist; it also creates a trashlog file inside the trashbin directory to
	keep track of the PATH of the removed files and directories as well as a
	subdirectory trash_content that stores the actual files and directories.

	The format of trashlog is as follows:
		filename (basename) -d/-f (directory/file) Absolute Filepath (of directory/file)
	
	srm does not allow the user to remove the current/parent directory; it also
	notes whether you entered a relative or absolute filepath (for convenience).

UNRM(1)									USER COMMANDS									UNRM(1)

NAME

	unrm - 'un-remove' files or directories from trashbin


SYNOPSIS

	unrm [FILE]...


DESCRIPTION

	unrm 'un-removes' files or directories that were 'safe removed' by srm; it
	returns an exit status of 1 if trashbin does not exist, trash_content is
	empty, it is given no arguments, or if the given file is not found in trashlog.

	unrm recovers the Absolute Filepath of the file or directory to be
	'un-removed.' It then calls mv(1) on the file or directory; it also
	calls grep(1) and sed(1) in order to remove the file information in
	trashlog. If there are multiple files or directories with the same name,
	then it 'un-removes' the first one ONLY.

DESCRIPTION

	exist or if trash_content is empty.

LSRM(1)									USER COMMANDS									LSRM(1)

NAME

	lsrm - lists the files and directories in trashbin


SYNOPSIS

	lsrm


DESCRIPTION

	lsrm lists in long listing format the files and directories in trashbin;
	it calls ls(1) -lRA, so it lists subdirectories recursively (but does not
	list implied . or .. because of option -A). It returns an exit status of
	1 if trashbin does not exist or if trash_content is empty.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


TRASH(1)									USER COMMANDS									TRASH(1)

NAME

	trash - empties the trashlog and trash_content


SYNOPSIS

	trash


DESCRIPTION

	trash clears the trashbin and the trashlog. Nothing much to say here.
	It returns an exit status of 1 if trashbin does not exist or if
	trash_content is empty.
